12,1,slide,page-title_article,"##Group Decision Making is Unchanged for 100 Years
-Meetings have issues
++Scalability
++Time to arrange, prepare and attend
++Frequently poorly planned and facilitated
++Biased to those with the loudest voices
-Voting has issues too
++Limited and unsuitable options
++Slow and costly
++Confrontational and somewhat corrupt
++Clearly politicised and seldom well aligned with the facts
-Both methods start with a hierarchy and generally seek to reinforce it - this is highly disengaging for the majority of participants
","It is difficult to hold an effective meeting with more than 20 people, we will have many decisions to make in the years ahead and better engagement with 7-8 Billion people as to the way forward seems reasonable to me.  Meetings take time to get setup and I spend far too much of my daily life attending meeting, yet if I dont go the I wont be heard and I wont know what people are proposing to do.  Some meetings are well structured and chaired but many arent and even when they are it is quite difficult to give equal voice to all points of view, this is particularly so if many times people just want to be somewhere else.

##What did the internet do?

-Telephone supported real time global communication
- But it was synchronous
- Email, Web and social networking are asynchronous
- This matters
- Group decision making remains synchronous

-Decision are made when a sufficient level of consensus is reached among the last n answers
-No requirement for meetings and no timeline for a vote are required
-Online platform supports the process and allows groups to enter, prioritize and decide on whatever is of interest to them
-Puts focus on points of disagreement
-In many meetings a lot of time is wasted discussing items which are basically agreed
-Avoids unnecessary conflict
-Avoids dominant individuals and political point scoring driving decisions

##What does the system handle?
-Questions
--Opinions should be in multiple choice format
--Facts to support a train of thought with evidence 
-Issues are areas of concern for prioritisation and confirmation
-Actions are proposed should be approved, planned and executed
-Resolved items can be challenged
-Projects and Events to group and link questions, issues and actions into a network
--Projects are open ended
--Events can be virtual or actual and run for a specific time eg a meeting
-Items can be linked to create a graph of the connections

 ",No point to answers with actions,,,,,||

##Why this matters

-World is underachieving
-Potentially a matter of life or death for half the planet
-No Global Strategy
-No focus
-Debt restructuring may make things worse
-Time for a change","Lets be clear I am not trying to replace either meetings or votes, I am just promoting the idea that we should try some alternatives to complement these well established methods.",,,,,||
17,1,slide,page-title_channel,"##Why has it not been done before?

-""If you build it - they will come""?
-Not that easy to start with
--Requires organisation, structure and logical thinking
-Demand for this is limited
--Politics is generally not looking for alternatives
--but democracy.earth is pursuing this space
--Most Managers and bosses are not looking for alternative tools for team decision making
--Social networking platforms profit from endless discussion
--Possibly some scope in voluntary organisations
-I am open to suggestions and feedback
",,,,,,||
18,1,slide,page-title_article,"##Why will it succeed?
-Change is seldom welcomed 
-So unfortunately it will be slow
-Social networking and democracy are both well established
-Inevitably, eventually the possibility to combine will twig and a tipping point will be reached
-Sooner the better if we want long happy lives
-Probably will require a degree of crisis to create the impetus for change
