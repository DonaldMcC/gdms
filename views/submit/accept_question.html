<p>You are awarded points for submitting items (issues, questions and actions) - however these only get credited to your score once the question has been resolved or the action has been agreed.
    Items that are more difficult and take longer to resolve are awarded more points.  However they need to be considered both urgent and important to get priority within the system.  You do not get any points for submitting an action unless it is approved.</p>

<h2>Follow on questions and actions</h2>
<p>You can submit a follow on item (issue, question or action). You can also create links between items and these can be seen using the show as network button which is available at various points on the site. </p>
