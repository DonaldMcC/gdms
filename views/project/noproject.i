<h3>About Projects</h3>
<p>Projects can be created to group items and both events and items can be linked to projects.  They provide a focus for
working on solutions to a group of items.  Items can only be linked to one project.  At present projects are not
archived like events as they do not pass in the same way.  However we may look at this option in future.</p>
