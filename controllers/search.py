#
# With thanks to Guido, Massimo and many other that make this sort of thing
# much easier than it used to be
#
# search is now using the haystack plugin and generating a full text index on question text only
# which we might add a capabilty to filter by action or question
# it will allow generation of a list of up to x items to display the questions and status which I
# think may just be another method of populating the existing review function
# so looks like the in operator would work for this - but most likely search is different and we keep
# as separate function to begin with until requirements fully understood
# but by some means search will get a list of 20 items (which may be hard coded) GQL is limited to 
# 30 and then go and retrieve the related ids so will always be two queries one on the full text search
# which probably needs a bit of further understanding on my part
# and then a second one to get the questions which would have pagination I think
#
# pagination to be added here at some point but currently search limit of 20 and refine search will do
# aiming to now support 3 searches and default will be a google simple search
