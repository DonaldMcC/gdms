# For details on the web framework used for this development
#
# With thanks to Guido, Massimo and many other that make this sort of thing
# much easier than it used to be
#
# This will be an initial contoller for displaying networks of questions
# current thinking is that layout will be managed server side and jointjs
# will handle the display and evnts side of things with networkx looking
# like the library for doing layouts with an underlying depenency on numpy
# General activities appear to be
# 1 get a list of nodes of some sort eg via search from events or locations
#   and possibly include 1 or 2 generations of links in either or both directions
# 2 get the links/edges between nodes
# 3 create a graph object and submit to networkx layout alogrithms and get a 
#   dictionary with positions of the nodes
# 4 in some way scale that to the proposed jointjs canvas looks like networkx is 
#   always square
# 5 Figure out how best to display the text and send results to jointjs
# 6 Collect new make link and delete link requests and decide whether to accept
#   or reject based on rules
# 7 Probably add rules to in some way pan and zoom through the network  - this 
#   may become computationally intense if large but initial stuff should be fine
#   getting more nodes via ajax looks doable but not sure about how the jointjs updates work
# created a networkforgaendb that supports belongs on datastore+ndb but will just revert to
# datastore for now and move on
