"""
 This controller handles viewing the full details on questions if allowed
 and also displaying the reason you are not allowed to view the question
 the functionality to submit a challenge is also included in this controller
 and that is called via ajax from the view of the question detail
 The three functions are:
 index:  displays the question details
 comments: add comments
 useranswers: shows detail of the useranswers -
 notshowing: explains why the question can't be displayed - actions should always be displayed
 challenge: allows submission of a challenge and return of whether this is allowed
 via ajax
 agree - ajax agreement or disagreement
 challenge - ajax submission to challenge
 flagcomment -
 urgency - ajax update urgency of item

 For actions not generally interested in user's views but would like these to be capable
 of prioritisation at any stage - need to see the date and will be some options to generate
 emails based on actions and also to challenge resolved actions to return them to proposed
 A separate comments function has now been created

    exposes:
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/index which has action, issue and question views
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/end_vote  #  Ajax call
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/useranswers
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/notshowing   
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/comments
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/challenge  #  Ajax call
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/agree  #  Ajax call
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/flagcomment  #  Ajax call
    http://..../[app]/viewquest/urgency  #  Ajax call
